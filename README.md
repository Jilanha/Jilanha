# 👋 Hi, I’m Hassan

I'm transitioning into cybersecurity after years of experience in tech, leadership, and operations.

🎯 **Current Goal**: Break into cybersecurity with a focus on blue team roles such as SOC Analyst or GRC Specialist.

🧠 **Currently Learning**:
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (Coursera)
- Hands-on labs with TryHackMe and Splunk
- Bash scripting, Linux command line, and basic Python

📂 **This GitHub Will Feature**:
- Lab reports and writeups
- Threat analysis projects
- Incident response simulations
- Notes and learning summaries

🔐 **Why Cybersecurity?**
Because I believe protecting data, systems, and people is the next essential frontier — and I want to be part of that defense.
